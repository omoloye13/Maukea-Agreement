                <b>GRACE PERIOD:</b>If, by the end of the Deferment Period, you inform us that you cannot redeem or pay
                in full, then we will provide a grace period extending the term for an additional 60 days after the
                original Termination Date, without any additional charge. However, as a condition of providing this
                grace period, you shall within the first 7 days of the grace period make an appointment with a consumer
                credit counseling agency and complete the counseling by the end of the grace period. We may verify this
                information with the agency. Furthermore, we will provide you with a list of approved consumer credit
                counseling agencies prepared by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, which includes nonprofit
                consumer credit counseling agencies affiliated with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling which
                provides credit counseling services to Florida residents in person, by telephone, or through the
                internet. The list includes phone numbers for the agencies, the counties served by the agencies, and
                indicates the agencies that provide telephone counseling and those that provide internet counseling. You
                may agree to comply with and adhere to a repayment plan approved by the counseling agency. If you agree
                to comply with and adhere to a repayment plan approved by the counseling agency, we will comply with and
                adhere to that repayment plan. We will not deposit or present your check for payment before the end of
                the 60-day grace period unless you fail to comply with such conditions or you fail to notify us of such
                compliance. If you complete an approved payment plan, we will pay one-half of the Deferred Presentment
                Fee under this Customer Agreement to the consumer credit counseling agency. However, if you fail to
                provide either the 7-Day or 60-Day notice, or if you have not made the appointment or completed the
                counseling within the time required, we may deposit or present your check for payment and pursue all
                legally available civil means to enforce the debt.
